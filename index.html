									<h2><a href="#">ADIDAS PROJECT</a></h2>
									<a href="https://github.com/Amairame/ADIDAS-PROJECT" class="image main"><img src="images/adidas.jpeg" alt="adidas" /></a>
									<p>The data science project on ADIDAS Sales showcased a comprehensive approach that included data cleansing and exploration in SQL, data visualization in Tableau, and data analysis in Python. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights from the sales data to drive informed decision-making and improve business performance.
										We started off with data cleansing and exploration in SQL. SQL queries were used to examine the sales data and handle data quality issues such as missing values, and outliers. The various data cleansing techniques used in SQL, ensure that the dataset is accurate, complete, and consistent, laying a strong foundation for subsequent analysis.
										Following data cleansing, Tableau was utilized to visualize the cleaned data. We created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard, using different types of charts, graphs, and maps to present sales patterns, regional performance, and product insights. Tableau's intuitive interface allows stakeholders to explore the data visually, gaining a deeper understanding of sales trends and identifying areas for improvement.
										To further delve into the data, Python was employed for advanced data analysis. Leveraging libraries such as pandas, NumPy, statistical analysis was performed such as predictive modeling. Through techniques like regression analysis, random forest, we uncovered valuable insights about customer behavior, and future sales projections. Python's versatility and extensive libraries provided the flexibility needed for complex analysis and modeling tasks.
										Overall, the ADIDAS Sales data science project exemplified the power of combining data cleansing and exploration in SQL, data visualization in Tableau, and data analysis in Python. It enables us to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, empowering decision-makers to make data-driven strategies that would enhance sales performance, and deliver a better customer experience.

									<a href="https://github.com/Amairame/Logistics-Regression" class="image fit"><img src="images/Logistics regression.jpg" alt="logistics" /></a>
									<p>The logistics project on Heart Disease data in R aimed to analyze and understand the factors influencing the occurrence of heart disease in individuals. Using R, a statistical programming language, we leverage Logistic regression techniques to identify significant predictors of Heart disease and develop a predictive model.</p>

									<p>Linear Regressions focus on understanding the relationships between variables and make predictions. The projects aimed to identify and quantify the impact of independent variables on a dependent variable of interest and predict outcomes in datasets. By leveraging R's functionalities, we gained valuable insights into the impact of independent variables and developed a model that could aid in decision-making and future predictions based on the dataset at hand.</p>

									<p>The unsupervised learning project in R on a Department Store dataset utilized clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. The project aimed to uncover patterns and structures within the data without predefined labels or target variables. Clustering techniques such as K-means or hierarchical clustering were applied to group similar departments or customer segments based on their characteristics. PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most important features driving the variability. By leveraging these unsupervised learning methods, the project aimed to gain insights into department store operations, customer behavior, and optimize business strategies.</p>
